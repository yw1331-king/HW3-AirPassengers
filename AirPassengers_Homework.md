# HW3 - AirPassengers Dataset 

## 1. Data File
The dataset file `HW3-AirPassengers.csv` has been prepared. It contains monthly international airline passenger counts (in thousands) from January 1949 to December 1960. The dataset is in CSV format with two columns: Date and Passengers.

## 3. Data Collection Methodology
The AirPassengers dataset was originally compiled by the **International Air Transport Association (IATA)**.  
It includes aggregated passenger counts from international airlines, collected on a monthly basis.  
The data was later used by statisticians **Box and Jenkins** as a classic example for time series forecasting, and is now included in the R statistical software as a built-in dataset.

## 4. Why This Dataset Intrigues Me
I chose the **AirPassengers dataset** because it is a classic benchmark for time series forecasting.  
The dataset clearly demonstrates both **trend** (increasing passenger counts over time) and **seasonality** (higher travel volumes during certain months, especially summer).  
These characteristics make it ideal for practicing forecasting models such as **ARIMA, exponential smoothing, and seasonal decomposition**.
